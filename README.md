The repository contains all files and selected data that was used for the manuscript "The relationship between urban greenery, mixed lan use and life satisfaction: An examination using remote sensing data and deep learning". Due to the terms of use of FORS, the Swiss Household Panel data used in the analysis can't be shared publicly. However, they can be requested at [FORS](https://forscenter.ch/projects/swiss-household-panel/data/) and matched with the remaining data using the household ID.

Please run the files in the following order:
